### Week 1 Summary:

In Week 1, I focused on **AWS fundamentals and account setup**. Understanding what Cloud Computing is and how AWS provides scalable, reliable, and cost-effective solutions was the foundation of my learning journey.

Learning about **AWS Global Infrastructure** helped me understand how AWS achieves high availability and low latency through its distributed architecture. The concept of Regions, Availability Zones, and Edge Locations is crucial for designing resilient applications.

The hands-on labs were extremely valuable. Through **Lab01**, I learned the importance of security best practices like enabling MFA and using IAM users instead of the root account. **Lab07** taught me how to monitor and control AWS costs using Budgets, which is essential for avoiding unexpected charges. **Lab09** introduced me to AWS Support options and how to get help when needed.

Understanding **AWS Management Tools** gave me multiple ways to interact with AWS services, from the user-friendly Console to the powerful CLI for automation.

This week's knowledge forms the **essential foundation** for working with AWS and sets me up for success in learning more advanced services in the coming weeks.
