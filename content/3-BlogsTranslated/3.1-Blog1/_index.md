## Introduction

Written by **Nick Paris**, Marketing Director of APN – AWS Partner Network.

The **AWS Partner Network (APN)** is a global community that leverages **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** technologies, programs, competencies, and tools to build solutions and deliver services for customers.

APN includes over **130,000 partners** from more than **200 countries**, with **70% headquartered outside the United States**. Together, partners and AWS deliver innovative solutions, solve technical challenges, win contracts, and bring greater value to customers.
