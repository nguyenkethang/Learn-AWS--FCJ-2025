# AI-Driven Development Life Cycle – Reimagining Software Engineering

## 🗓 Event Information

- **Time:** 14:00 – 16:30, Friday, October 3, 2025
- **Location:** AWS Event Hall, 26th Floor, Bitexco Tower, Ho Chi Minh City

## 👨‍🏫 Speakers

- **Toan Huynh** – Specialist Solutions Architect, PACE
- **My Nguyen** – Senior Prototyping Architect, Amazon Web Services – ASEAN

## 🎯 Main Topic

Applying AI throughout the software development lifecycle with Amazon Q Developer and Kiro

## 🔍 Event Overview

This AWS GenAI Builder Club event brought a fresh and practical perspective on how AI is reshaping the software development process. With the presence of two advanced tools – Amazon Q Developer and Kiro, attendees witnessed how AI can support from the ideation stage to product deployment.

## 🧠 In-Depth Content From Presentation Sessions

### 1. AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DDLC)

Speaker Toan Huynh presented the AI-DDLC model, where AI plays a coordinating role throughout the software development process: from planning, task decomposition, system architecture proposals to deployment. However, developers still maintain the role of review and final decision-making, ensuring accuracy and alignment with business objectives.

### 2. Kiro – AI IDE from prototype to production

Speaker My Nguyen introduced Kiro – an AI-integrated development environment (AI IDE) that helps transform prompts into clear results, system design, and deployment. With the philosophy of spec-driven development, Kiro brings clear structure to the AI programming process, helping programmers control the entire development lifecycle.

### 3. Agent Hooks – Intelligent Automation

A highlight was the ability to set up agent hooks – automated AI tasks triggered by events like "file save". These agents can automatically generate documentation, write unit tests, or optimize code performance, helping scale work without manual intervention.

### 4. Maximize Semantics per Token – Optimizing AI Input

Instead of feeding in thousands of lines of code, Kiro encourages using semantically rich intermediate models like user stories or component diagrams. This helps AI understand better and respond more accurately, avoiding waste of tokens and processing resources.

### 5. Anti-Patterns – Common Mistakes to Avoid When Using AI

The session also pointed out common anti-patterns such as:

- Using AI once for multi-step problems
- Not refreshing context frequently
- Letting AI exceed control scope
- Lacking structure when working with legacy systems (brownfield)

### 6. System Architecture and User Story Grouping

Attendees were guided on how to group user stories into functional units like User Management Service, Booking Service, etc. Each unit has clear task descriptions, acceptance criteria, and non-functional requirements – helping increase predictability, improve quality, and accelerate market response.

### 7. AI Development Roadmap in Software (2020–2024)

A notable slide described the evolution of AI in software development:

- **2020:** Code auto-completion
- **2022:** AI assistants supporting large code blocks and answering questions
- **2024:** AI agents capable of completing entire development tasks with humans in the loop

## 🎯 Results and Impact

The session helped attendees:

- Understand how AI can accelerate development, from idea to product
- Improve software quality and customer satisfaction
- Create an engaging work environment, helping programmers focus on creativity
- Drive continuous improvement in the development process

Kiro is recognized as an important step in bringing AI into the role of a true collaborator – not just supporting but also understanding context, analyzing architecture, and providing valuable suggestions.

## ✍️ Personal Reflection

Attending the "AI-Driven Development Life Cycle" session was an extremely valuable experience for me. What impressed me most was how Kiro is designed not only to support but also to deeply understand the software development context – from analyzing user stories, grouping them into functional units, to proposing system architecture and deploying according to spec-driven standards.

I particularly appreciate the philosophy of "AI as a collaborator" – where AI doesn't replace humans but plays an intelligent support role, helping me focus on more creative and strategic aspects. Using agent hooks to automate tasks like writing documentation or testing also opens up tremendous potential in optimizing daily workflows.

The presentations by Toan Huynh and My Nguyen were very clear, practical, and inspiring. I look forward to applying Kiro to upcoming projects, especially systems with complex architectures or requiring deep business analysis.

If possible, I hope future sessions will delve deeper into integrating Kiro with CI/CD tools and project management platforms like Jira or GitHub – to better see how AI can accompany throughout the software development lifecycle.

## 🎓 Key Learnings From the Event

### 1. Modern Software Development Mindset with AI

AI is not just a support tool but also plays a coordinating role throughout the software development lifecycle. Task decomposition, architecture proposals, and test automation can all be handled by AI, helping developers focus on strategic decisions.

### 2. Kiro – AI IDE Shaping the Future of Application Development

Kiro brings a new approach: spec-driven development. Instead of writing code from scratch, developers can start from business requirements, letting AI automate the implementation. This accelerates development speed, reduces errors, and ensures consistency in system architecture.

### 3. Optimizing AI Input with Semantics

An important lesson is: AI doesn't "think in code" but reasons through meaning. Providing semantically rich input like user stories, component diagrams, or business models helps AI respond more accurately and saves processing resources.

### 4. Avoiding Anti-Patterns When Working with AI

Common mistakes like handling multi-step problems with a single AI call, not refreshing context, or letting AI exceed control scope can all lead to undesired results. Understanding anti-patterns helps developers use AI more effectively.

### 5. Intelligent Automation with Agent Hooks

The ability to set up agents that automatically trigger on events like "file save" helps scale work without manual intervention. This is a major step forward in integrating AI into DevOps processes.

### 6. AI Evolution Roadmap in Software Development

From auto-complete (2020) to assistants (2022) and agents (2024), AI is gradually taking on more complex roles, moving toward the ability to complete entire development tasks with humans in the loop.

## 🧭 Lessons Learned

- **AI doesn't replace humans, but enhances human capabilities.** Maintaining the role of review and final decision-making is crucial to ensuring quality and ethics in software development.

- **Structure and semantics are key to AI effectiveness.** Providing clear, organized information helps AI understand correctly and respond accurately.

- **Software architecture thinking needs to adapt to AI.** Grouping user stories into functional units, building component models, and deploying according to specs is an approach suitable for AI-assisted environments.

- **Automation is not just about saving time, but also improving quality.** Agent hooks help ensure documentation, testing, and optimization are always updated timely.
