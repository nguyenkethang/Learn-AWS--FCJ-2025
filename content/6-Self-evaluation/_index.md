During my internship at **Amazon Web Services Vietnam Co., Ltd** from **2025/09/08** to **2025/12/30**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge acquired in school to a real-world working environment.

Throughout the internship, I participated in **comprehensive AWS cloud computing training**, completing **over 50 hands-on labs** covering core AWS services including VPC, EC2, S3, RDS, IAM, Lambda, and various database and analytics services. I also designed and proposed a **Blood Donation Support System (BDSS)** project using AWS 3-tier architecture, demonstrating my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to solve real-world healthcare challenges.

Through this experience, I improved my skills in **cloud architecture design, infrastructure automation, security implementation, database management, CI/CD pipeline configuration, technical documentation, and problem-solving**. I actively participated in **5 AWS workshops and events** including AI/ML/GenAI, DevOps, and Security Pillar workshops, which enhanced my understanding of modern cloud technologies and best practices.

In terms of work ethic, I always strived to complete tasks well, maintained detailed weekly worklogs documenting my learning progress, complied with workplace regulations, and actively engaged with colleagues and the AWS community to improve work efficiency and knowledge sharing.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:

### Needs Improvement:

* **Discipline**: While I completed all assigned tasks, I need to strengthen time management to avoid last-minute submissions and maintain more consistent daily work schedules. I should establish better routines for starting work on time and taking structured breaks.

* **Communication**: Although my technical documentation is comprehensive, I need to improve verbal communication skills when presenting ideas to non-technical stakeholders. I should practice explaining complex AWS concepts in simpler terms and develop better storytelling techniques for project proposals.

* **Problem-solving under pressure**: While I can solve technical problems given sufficient time, I need to improve my ability to troubleshoot issues quickly during live incidents or time-constrained scenarios. I should practice more real-world debugging scenarios and develop systematic troubleshooting frameworks.
