### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment at AWS FCJ Workforce Program is highly professional and welcoming. The office at Bitexco Financial Tower, 26th floor, features modern, spacious facilities with comprehensive equipment supporting learning and work. Team members are always ready to help and create a positive working atmosphere. Particularly, working in an advanced cloud computing environment has allowed me to access cutting-edge technologies and industry best practices.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
Mentors and team admins provide dedicated and professional support. They not only offer detailed technical guidance but also share practical experience in AWS architecture design, cost optimization, and security best practices. What I appreciate most is the "learning by doing" approach - mentors encourage me to research, experiment, and solve problems independently before providing suggestions. This has helped me develop independent thinking and troubleshooting skills.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
The internship program aligns perfectly with my Information Security major. I applied knowledge of security, networking, cryptography, and risk management to real-world projects on AWS Cloud. Particularly, implementing security best practices such as VPC isolation, IAM policies, encryption at rest/in transit, Security Groups, and CloudTrail audit logging helped me deeply understand cloud security architecture. I also learned how to assess and mitigate security risks, ensure compliance (HIPAA), and design systems following defense-in-depth principles. This knowledge not only complements the security theory learned at university but also expands my perspective on cloud security - a highly sought-after field in Information Security.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
During the 12-week internship, I significantly developed the following skills:

**Technical Skills:**
- Proficient in 15+ core AWS services with focus on security (IAM, VPC, Security Groups, KMS, Secrets Manager, CloudTrail, GuardDuty)
- Mastered Infrastructure as Code with CloudFormation for secure infrastructure deployment
- Deployed full-stack applications with security best practices (authentication, authorization, encryption, CORS, input validation)
- Designed 3-tier cloud architecture with high availability and security best practices (defense in depth, least privilege, network segmentation)
- Understanding of compliance and audit logging (CloudTrail, CloudWatch Logs)
- Configured monitoring and security alerting systems (CloudWatch Alarms, SNS notifications)
- Optimized AWS costs (achieved 27% savings with VPC Endpoints) while maintaining security

**Soft Skills:**
- Professional technical documentation writing
- Effective time management and self-learning
- Systematic problem-solving thinking
- Ability to research and apply new technologies

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The working culture at AWS FCJ clearly reflects AWS's core values: Customer Obsession, Ownership, Invent and Simplify, Learn and Be Curious. Everyone is always willing to share knowledge and support each other in workshops and events. I was particularly impressed by the continuous learning spirit - from workshops on AI/ML/GenAI, DevOps to Security Pillar, all were professionally organized and delivered real value.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**

- Reasonable internship allowance
- AWS account with credits for hands-on practice
- Comprehensive learning materials and lab exercises (50+ labs)
- Opportunities to participate in AWS workshops and events for free
- Professional working environment with full equipment
- Flexible working hours compatible with academic schedule

### Additional Questions

**What did you find most satisfying during your internship?**  
What I found most satisfying was applying Information Security knowledge to real cloud projects. Designing and implementing security architecture for the DNA Analysis Application with multiple security layers (CloudFront HTTPS, API Gateway throttling, VPC isolation, Security Groups, RDS encryption, IAM roles, CloudTrail audit logs) helped me deeply understand defense-in-depth strategy. Particularly, the AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar workshop and self-research on security services like GuardDuty, WAF, and Secrets Manager expanded my perspective on cloud security. Achieving 99.95% uptime with security best practices and 27% cost optimization proves that security and cost-efficiency can go hand in hand.

**What do you think the company should improve for future interns?**  
Some improvement suggestions, especially for Information Security students:
- Organize more security architecture review sessions and penetration testing workshops
- Provide clearer roadmap for AWS Security certifications (Security - Specialty) and exam preparation support
- Add hands-on labs on incident response, security monitoring with GuardDuty, Security Hub, and threat detection
- Create networking opportunities with AWS Security specialists or customers to understand real-world security challenges
- Organize CTF (Capture The Flag) or security challenges to practice skills
- Add modules on compliance frameworks (ISO 27001, SOC 2, PCI-DSS) on AWS

**If recommending to a friend, would you suggest they intern here? Why or why not?**  
I would definitely recommend this program to friends, especially those studying Information Security because:
- **Cloud Security is the future**: 90%+ enterprises are migrating to cloud, demand for cloud security professionals is very high with attractive salaries
